# helloworld
This is the obligatory hello world readme. i should say something about myself here like: "i'm really excited to start my github experience" but i'm actually intimidated by the projects i've seen so far and doubtful over my contribution being helpful at the big boys table. I'm not a negative person by nature so I might start a project called the 'Kiddie Table' and investigate this more. :)
